abstract: Early diagnosis and intervention of brain diseases play a very important role in medication and treatment. At present, the detection method of physiological signals has been used in the early screening of brain diseases and has become one of the important auxiliary methods, especially the brain imaging technology for brain diseases and mental disorders and the undisturbed human gait recognition technology, and accumulated A lot of data. Because the traditional diagnosis method depends on the scale and the professional quality of the doctor, the clinical diagnosis results are highly subjective. With the development of smart medicine, researchers can understand and quantify the impact of mental illness on the brain under the objective conditions of multi-modal physiological signals. Brain disease diagnosis is a complex decision-making process. As a powerful data-driven tool, machine learning methods can provide auxiliary means for brain disease classification and early prediction and diagnosis, and reveal the correlation mechanism between brain cognition, behavior and related brain diseases. This paper focuses on two aspects of brain disease diagnosis and analysis: (1) Research on epilepsy detection algorithm based on homotopy dictionary learning; (2) Research on gait kinematics feature detection and prediction joint model for depression. (1) The study of internal signals in the brain has become one of the hotspots in the field of cognitive science in recent years. Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in cognitive neuroscience because of its strong correlation with brain activity and high time resolution. Clinical diagnosis of brain diseases and related research on brain-computer interface. As a chronic mental illness, EEG plays an important role in epilepsy detection, especially automatic detection due to its suddenness and repetitiveness. In this article, an algorithm based on homotopy dictionary learning is proposed to detect epileptic seizures. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on a public database. Compared with the traditional sparse representation method, in the same operating environment, the homotopy dictionary learning algorithm can complete the test with only 19.671 s. It has a higher degree of automation and is better than the classic Dictionary learning algorithm. The average recognition rate is as high as 99.5%. The results show that the epilepsy detection system based on homotopy dictionary learning has high application value. (2) In recent years, gait analysis has become an effective tool for medical care. The natural gait analysis system can be used as an undisturbed, natural and objective tool to assist in the analysis of depression. In the study, we found that there are significant differences in gait parameters such as time, space, movement, and posture between people with depression and normal controls. Applying these parameters to the machine learning classification algorithm to classify the two groups of people, especially the Adaboost classifier, the maximum accuracy can reach 95.53%. Finally, since the goal of gait prediction is to be able to predict the gait trajectory of a given individual, we obtain their joint angle trajectory in the gait cycle through the input of their gait parameters, and use the regression model to train the multiple time for joint angle analysis. sequence. The standard root mean square error (RMSE) was used as the performance evaluation parameter of the regression model, and the regression quantification model of its joint motion trajectory was established to distinguish the depressive disorder population from the normal control population. To sum up, this article starts from the prediction, evaluation and diagnostic testing requirements for the two major chronic brain diseases of depression and epilepsy, starting from the direction of multi-signal analysis, introducing the end-to-end computing method of machine learning classification model and developing the l1 model. The new homotopy dictionary learning algorithm under the mathematical framework provides new ideas for clinical diagnosis of depression and epileptic seizures to a certain extent.
